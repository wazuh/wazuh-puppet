# @summary Creates a puppet file mountpoint for generated certificates
# on the Puppet server. If you have separate CAs and compilers, you'll
# need to implement syncing of some sort (a network share, rsync, etc)
# and include this class on all compilers as well as the CA.
# Potential improvements: 
# - Restrict access to the mountpoint with entries in auth.conf
