# Not sure this is the best hierarchy, but acceptable stab at it.
#   Specifically, 'distro' may not be the best name for what we're
#   trying to capture. Ideally it should probaly be under the 'os'
#   directory, but then you get that ugly 'RedHat.yaml' next to the 
#   'RedHat' subdirectory. This layout seems slightly easier for the 
#   layperson to grasp for the time being.
hierarchy:
  - name: "OS Release"
    path: "distro/%{facts.os.name}-%{facts.os.release.major}.yaml"
  - name: "OS Family"
    path: "family/%{facts.os.family}.yaml"
  - name: "OS Kernel"
    path: "kernel/%{facts.kernel}.yaml"
  - name: "common"
    path: "common.yaml"
